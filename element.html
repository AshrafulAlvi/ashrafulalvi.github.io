			<h1>Getting Started</h1>
			<br>

			<p>Now that you have your equipments and you want to start photography you need to plan out some aspects  on how to start. You can't just go outside and start shooting pictures. You might get pictures but it is very unlikely that they will come out as better as you have expected. So, to get started you need to know about lights, perspective, shadow, focus, fill and so on. It is difficult for us to teach you all this stuff in a website. You need a real life experience for that type of knowledge. For that, you can either go to any classes or follow someone professional to learn on hand. We will provide some crash courses and people for these type of concerns down below.
